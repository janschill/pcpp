#5.1.4.
We noticed that at the beginning the execution is slower due to "warm up" but later
it became more constant and faster. Work stealing pool has more variations than Cached
thread pool in its execution.The best performance would be to use 1 thread per core. In
my case, that would be 4-5 threads since I have 4 cores. The surprise is when you get 
better execution with 1 or >10 threads.
